# Contributing to CoreTex

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the CoreTex project! We welcome contributions from the community to improve our anomaly detection platform.

## 1. Setting Up Your Local Development Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Click the "Fork" button on the top right of the [CoreTex repository](https://github.com/GizzZmo/CoreTex).

2. **Clone Your Fork**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/CoreTex.git
   cd CoreTex
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   CoreTex is built primarily with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.  
   If there are npm dependencies, install them:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   (If there is no `package.json`, you can skip this step.)

4. **Run the Development Server**  
   If using a simple static server:
   ```sh
   npx serve .
   ```
   Or open `index.html` directly in your browser.

## 2. Running the Test Suite

If the repository includes automated tests (for example, with Jest or similar):

```sh
npm test
```

If there are no automated tests, please ensure any changes are manually tested in your browser for function and style.

## 3. Coding Standards and Style Guide

- **HTML:** Use semantic markup, proper indentation (2 spaces), and close all tags.
- **JavaScript:** Follow ES6+ standards, use `const` and `let` appropriately, 2-space indentation, and meaningful variable names.
- **CSS:** Use classes instead of inline styles, 2-space indentation, and organize rules logically.
- **General:** Write descriptive comments for complex logic and follow existing code patterns.  
- **Linting:** If a linter configuration exists, run it before submitting your changes.

## 4. Pull Request Process

1. **Fork** the repository and **clone** your fork locally.
2. **Create a new branch** for your changes:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. **Commit** your changes with clear, descriptive messages.
4. **Push** your branch to your fork:
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. **Open a Pull Request** from your branch to `main` on the [original repository](https://github.com/GizzZmo/CoreTex).
6. **Link your pull request to an issue** if applicable.
7. **Participate in the code review process** by responding to comments and making requested changes.

## 5. "Open an Issue First" Policy

For any significant changes (new features, major refactors, changes to core logic), **please open an issue first** to discuss your proposal with the maintainers.  
This ensures your idea is aligned with the project goals and avoids duplicating effort.

- Minor fixes (typos, small bug fixes) do **not** require a prior issue.
- For significant work, please wait for approval or feedback on the issue before opening a pull request.
